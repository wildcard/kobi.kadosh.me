## Key Insights from Session

### Technical Insights
- **Modern CSS Module Integration**: CSS modules require careful handling of imports and class name references
- **Sass Modernization**: The shift from @import to @use/@forward requires namespace handling
- **Dependency Management**: Long-dormant projects require careful, incremental updating of dependencies
- **Gatsby Migration**: Moving from v2/v3 to v5 required updates to image handling, CSS modules, and plugin configurations
- **Documentation Value**: Creating thorough documentation speeds future maintenance and modifications

### Content/Blog Insights
- **Evolution of Development Advice**: The evolution from "read more" to "co-create with AI" represents a natural progression
- **Timeless Core Principles**: The core value of research before coding remains, but the tools have changed
- **Human-AI Collaboration**: Developers need to balance AI collaboration with their own expertise
- **Terminology Matters**: "Co-creation" better captures the collaborative relationship than "consulting"
- **Meta-Learning**: Using AI to write about AI collaboration creates a recursive learning opportunity
